### Description

A Template for a XP-Styled Wizard like Microsoft-Products use 'em. Don't found something like this here, so i did my own one. Useable for Installations, PlugIns or (you guess it) Wizards.

Key-Features:

* Easily add as many steps as you want.

* Work with the collected data after every step, at the end of the wizard or both, what you like.

* Timer-Controled, not Button-Controled.

* Jump between Steps easily

* Includes XP-Progressbar by Aki (Just change to a CommonControl-Bar if you don't like it)

Known Bugs: None.
